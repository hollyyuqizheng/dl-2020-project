every day farmers hunters and fishermen haul their bounty to nodines the states only smokehouse tucked away on a deadend street in torrington
fishermen bring coolers and buckets overflowing with freshly caught trout and salmon and chunks of ocean tuna
in season they bring pails of fresh bluefish and connecticut river shad
hunters come with venison pheasant ducks geese and wild turkeys
farmers deliver hogs chickens turkeys and beef to the spotless white processing plant
custom smoking now accounts for only a small part of the business at nodines which grossed  million last year
but when ron and johanne nodine opened their first smokehouse  years ago custom smoking was the whole business
ron was an unemployed computer engineer and i worked at the post office and as a cream tester for cows recalled mrs nodine
for  we bought an old wooden smokehouse from a fellow in burrville who did custom smoking in the winter
he was going to teach us everything
but that weekend he had a heart attack and died
my husband had one day of instruction from a uconn ag professor and we were in business
the nodines set up the smokehouse on their acre farm in goshen
then they reluctantly expanded into retailing with ham and bacon
mrs nodine said people would say remember the pig i raised last year
i need a ham for easter
we had no intention of entering retail but people asked for it
the couple then brought their nitritefree bacon to balduccis and zabars the specialty markets in manhattan
the business was off and running  until they had to cope with a tidal wave of fat
tiny goshen had no sewers and the nodines land could not support a complex septic system
their room house had already given up six rooms to the business which threatened to take over every inch of remaining space
so three years ago the nodines decided to move into an old knitting mill in nearby torrington
the conversion took a year and began with ripping out five miles of concrete floor to install grease traps
today more than  percent of the fat is captured in barrels in the cellar and sold for use in cosmetics
torrington is happy to have the nodines said mayor delia donne adding their mailorder business is making us well known all over the country
mrs nodine said we moved here and i would say our sales dropped to where they had been two years earlier
it was not the time to move
however i dont think you would find a bank today that would be willing to lend the money to put in the plant
were talking a million and a half dollars unless you happen to have a million dollars already
the smokehouse is redolent of barbecue spices
barrels of chicken breasts slabs of bacon and racks of spareribs await smoking curing in a mixture of salt water sugar spices and preservatives
a fineflake combination of south carolina hickory and new england sugar maple smolders on metal trays and the smoke is forced into the smokers large steel boxes
this combination of wood produces a flavor that is lighter than stuff smoked over corn cobs and mesquite explained the sales manager at nodines khoury mubarek
trout takes four hours of smoking and  minutes of cooking he said
turkeys weighing  to  pounds are reduced to  pounds by  to  hours of cooking and smoking
smoked meat is fully cooked and does not require any further cooking
these delicacies are expensive
but amid the smoked salmon and finnish gruyere are several barrels of mundane ground turkey destined for connecticuts prisons
many prisoners dont eat pork explained mr mubarek
every month we supply a halfton of smoked turkey kielbasa for a privatelabel company that sells to the state prison system
much of nodines product is marketed by six glossy catalogue companies and in manhattan specialty stores and restaurants
nodines issues a small folder listing its own products as well
gourmetstyle smoked food is returning to popularity mr mubarek said although only three other smokehouses remain in new england fewer than  nationally
a small retail shop in goshen behind the nodines home offers smoked ham turkey quail and goose
the shops freezer holds venison steak and buffalo stew smoked kielbasa cornish game hens and idaho trout
smoked pepper jack cheese gruyere swiss and provolone crowd the delicatessen case
the shop also offers moroccan oil ginger jelly pickled fiddleheads apple ketchup and canned elk
weve smoked every fish that swims in the ocean mr mubarek said
one manhattan restaurant wanted smoked tomatoes and smoked onions for a special menu he said
nodines imports rattlesnake from california venison from new zealand farms scallops from iceland and shrimp from bangladesh for smoking
the only connecticut product the business purchases is pheasant from glastonbury mr mubarek said
all the fish it sells is farm raised except bluefish tuna and pacific swordfish
i never buy swordfish from the east coast he said
i worry about mercury contamination
health concerns about nitrites do not seem to have affected nodines sales although the company now offers nitritefree bacon turkey and chicken breast pheasant and quail
the nitrite scare has passed said mrs nodine
some customers say why cant we use oldfashioned saltpeter
of course i tell them thats the same thing
although each week nodines sells up to three tons of chicken breast its most popular item the bad economy hurts us because restaurants are the largest single failing business in the country now mr mubarek said
to compensate for the weakened new england economy the business is expanding its market into michigan florida and georgia he said
the federal department of agriculture occupies an office on the premises and has the right to inspect the meat at any time
the departments officer who rotates through nodines and three other nearby plants is responsible for checking sanitation product quality the formula of the curing liquid and the label information for new products
recipes for those new products are adjusted through a tastetesting process mrs nodine said
her husband usually makes a product and says i want everyones opinion  she said
we went out to a friends house for sunday dinner with three sausage samples
he said all right what do you like
everyone said forget the second sausage the first was spicy and the third was bland
what do you need the middle one for
the smokehouse began as a business my husband and i could work at together said mrs nodine
they still work together  along with  employees
with a weak economy and unpredictable consumer taste she said the business is changing rapidly
mrs nodine added i had a group of high school kids come in the other day and i told them if you go into business dont think youre going to stay in that same business
you have to change
i didnt want to get any bigger
but a business is like a baby it grows or it dies

as employers and export partners japanese companies are rapidly becoming a significant part of connecticuts economy
within the states generally gloomy economic environment  japaneseowned companies continue to flourish and grow usually reporting positive experiences about life in connecticut
and the state is hungry for more foreign capital and companies
in rocky hill the state office of economic development has an international division that focuses on the needs of foreignowned companies
in tokyo the connecticut far east office has represented the states exporters and aspiring exporters for five years
it also has tried to persuade japanese companies to open offices and manufacturing plants in the state
japan is the secondlargest trading partner of the state of connecticut said the states commissioner of economic development joseph mcgee
were in a global economy now and japanese companies find connecticut an attractive place in which to do business
we think thats great
we just want to make sure we can sell our products in japan
canada is the nation that buys the most connecticut products about  billion worth annually
but last year japan came in second buying  million commissioner mcgee said
while no one is certain how many people are employed by the states  foreignowned businesses officials agree that the the  germanowned companies employ the largest number
japanese companies in connecticut employ  people in the state mr mcgee reported
maintaining good relations with their communities is a high priority for japanese companies state officials said adding that most are sensitive to the towns needs and enthusiastically support local events with donations and volunteers
though connecticut communities have generally welcomed japanese companies one rare exception was a hate letter sent to ronald shaw the american president of pilot pen a japaneseowned company in trumbull
you are sick and a disgrace to many true americans who fought in world war ii wrote an anonymous correspondent who signed himself a true american and called mr shaw a traitor
mr shaw a member of the executive committee of the national antidefamation league of bnai brith said it brought back horrible memories from my own childhood
as a child growing up in the s i was beaten and my family had our windows broken because we were jews
his company underwrites charitable and community activities to be a good corporate neighbor not as any kind of coverup mr shaw said
wed do this if we were solely an americanowned firm
the yearold pilot pen open tennis tournament at the yale tennis courts supports probus club activities benefiting the handicapped as well as the special olympics and programs for retarded and autistic people
the programs cost pilot pen about  annually said the company which also sponsors a literary competition in trumbull that offers  in prizes
pilot pen which came to new york in  and moved to connecticut in  employs about  workers including five japanese on a three to fiveyear rotation a pattern typical for japanese companies in the united states
small numbers of japanese executives often come with their families for several years service perfecting their english and learning american business practices firsthand
they are then brought home and other executives from japan replace them
despite negative publicity regarding japanese investment in the united states many executives say they have been treated warmly here
i see hostility toward japanese on tv and read about it in the papers but i do not feel any us hostility personally said terry kawaura president of konica business machines usa based in windsor
a strong presence
japanese companies are not only extremely careful in their dealings with surrounding communities executives said but also in their relations with their employees
konica scrupulously follows american laws governing affirmative action and age discrimination mr kawaura said
konica came to connecticut because it had sold exclusive distribution rights in  to royal business machines a yearold connecticut company
by  konica owned  percent of the american company and decided to stay
konica does no manufacturing in connecticut focusing on import and distribution of imported copiers laser printers facsimile machines and related consumer products in the united states where it has  branches and in canada
mr kawaura said that relations between the two nations would be improved if japanese companies established manufacturing plants in the united states
in japan ibm
manufactures and exports their products successfully he said
reebok and nike american companies have plants in korea and export to japan
we should establish more manufacturing plants here in connecticut
konica employs  people in connecticut and six japanese citizens in middle management
i manage this company with a mix of japanese style and american style explained mr kawaura
for example we dont lay people off and we promote from within
